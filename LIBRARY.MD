## README

This library pre-dates the GitHub convention of repositories with matching names becoming a customizable interface for user homepages.
Ergo, this library's "README" is saved in this document rather than a conventional README.

## Installation

A deployed copy of the most recent version of [nnichols can be found on clojars.](https://clojars.org/nnichols)
To use it, add the following as a dependency in your project.clj file:

[![Clojars Project](http://clojars.org/nnichols/latest-version.svg)](http://clojars.org/nnichols)

The next time you build your application, [Leiningen](https://leiningen.org/) should pull it automatically.
Alternatively, you may clone or fork the repository to work with it directly.

## Usage

Once the project has been added, you can require in any namespace and use them freely.
